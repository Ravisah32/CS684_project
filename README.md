# Line Following Robot

This project is an implementation of a line following robot, designed to autonomously navigate along a visible line on the ground. The robot utilizes sensors to detect the line and motors to adjust its direction, ensuring continuous movement along the path.

## Features

- Real-time line detection and tracking
- Autonomous navigation along various line patterns
- Modular code structure for easy customization and enhancement

## Project Structure

- **Sensors**: Code for interfacing with line sensors
- **Control Algorithms**: Logic for steering and speed control
- **Hardware Integration**: Modules for motor drivers and microcontroller communication

## Getting Started

To get started, review the project files related to sensor setup, control algorithms, and hardware connections. Youâ€™ll need basic hardware components including line sensors, a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi), and motor drivers.
